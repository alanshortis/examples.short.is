# examples.short.is

> Code examples for writings at [https://short.is](short.is).

Self hosting code examples rather than using CodePen or similar, just for a little extra control.

All examples have any and all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file. I owe my career to View Source, so I'd like to try and keep that an available option. It's hard to come by these days.
